# Bubble Sort 

This project lets the user create two arrays, one with integers and one with characters, and then sorts them both using a bubble sort algorithm in an ascending order.
The sorting logic is written in separate functions (bubble_sort_int and bubble_sort_char) that take a comparison function pointer, so the sort can work in either ascending or descending order,
although the main.c program is automatically selected to sort in ascending order which can be altered as needed.
